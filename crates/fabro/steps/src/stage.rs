//! `fabro/stage`: Fabro's structural stages (`start`, `exit`, a
//! conditional) as a step that records where its scope runs.
//!
//! The engine acquires a scope's environment when the first firing in it is
//! admitted, after the admission hooks ran. A hook that must run in the
//! sandbox (`sandbox = true`, the default for command hooks) therefore
//! needs the environment from a step that has already run in that scope.
//! Every Fabro step registers its environment in [`ScopeEnvironments`]
//! through [`record`]; `start` is the first, so `sandbox_ready` and every
//! later stage hook find it. The step itself does what `noop` did: it
//! returns its resolved config as its output.
