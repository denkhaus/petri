//! The host-facing hook service: one interface a local hook executor and an
//! embedding host both implement, and one adapter that calls it from the
//! driver's awaited extension points, so a configured hook runs exactly once
//! whoever serves it.
//!
//! The split is deliberate. A [`HookService`] answers "run the hooks
//! configured for this point, on this subject, and tell me the decision".
//! Which hooks are configured, how a command hook's exit code becomes a
//! decision, and what a timeout means are the service's business: the local
//! implementation reads the workflow's configuration; a platform host reads
//! its own. The [`HookAdapter`] is the one caller: it implements
//! [`ExecutionHooks`] and asks the service at each point, records the
//! service's report as a `hook` note, and turns the decision into the
//! driver's admission, result, or transition answer. Nothing else in Petri
//! calls a hook service for a workflow point, so installing one service
//! means each hook executes once.
//!
//! A few points are not driven by the adapter, because the driver is not
//! where they happen: the tool-boundary points (`BeforeToolUse`,
//! `AfterToolUse`, `AfterToolFailure`) are asked by the agent backend's tool
//! middleware at the actual tool boundary; `ScopeReady` and `RunStarted`, and
//! the admission points of a node whose frontend marked it
//! [`ADMISSION_HOOKS_META`]` = "step"`, are asked by the step that runs first
//! in the scope's environment (the sandbox has to exist before a hook can be
//! placed in it); `ForkStarted` and `ForkCompleted` are asked by the fork
//! step and the fan-in step, the two places that run exactly once per fork
//! visit (a `for_each` fork has one routing group, so the driver cannot see
//! it at admission). Every one of them reaches the same service through the
//! [`HookServiceHandle`] capability, so a host that replaces the service
//! receives every point, and each point is asked exactly once.
