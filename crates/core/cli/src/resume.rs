//! `petri resume --run-dir <dir>`: continue a run from its run directory.
//!
//! The run directory is the record (`run.json`, `coordinator.jsonl`, the
//! registered graphs, one engine log per execution). Nothing else is needed:
//! not the workflow file, not its inputs. The format is found from the
//! stored root graph (`Frontend::claims_graph`), and its launch settings and
//! default retention apply as they did to `petri run`. The interviewer,
//! control file, retention, echo, provider and backend options are the
//! session's own and are given again; a gate that was waiting when the
//! process died asks again, and the new interviewer answers it.
//!
//! What a resume does not restore: an agent node's retained thread. As in
//! Fabro, a node that was mid-turn starts a fresh session from the
//! `summary:high` preamble.
//!
//! Before anything starts, the command reads the coordinator log through a
//! read handle (no lease) and refuses, with exit code 2 and no work done: a
//! run that already recorded its finish, a run another process holds (the
//! lease), a paused run given no `--control` file (nothing could unpause
//! it), and a run directory that is missing or does not decode.
