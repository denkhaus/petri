//! Core, assembled.
//!
//! Every other core crate is one layer and names no other implementation: the
//! IR knows no executor, the executor interface knows no backend, the frontend
//! trait knows no format. This crate is the one place those pieces are wired
//! together — [`Runtime`] holds a frontend list, a step registry, an executor
//! per [`ir::RuntimeTarget`], secrets and options, and drives a graph with the
//! replay canary on. It is also the facade: [`ir`], [`engine`], [`driver`],
//! [`frontend`], [`steps`] and [`executor`] are reachable through it, so one
//! dependency reaches all of core.
//!
//! The wiring goes one way. A component — another workflow format, another step
//! kind — *registers onto* this builder with [`Runtime::frontend`] and
//! [`Runtime::step`]; nothing registers *into* it, and no crate under `core`
//! names a component. The distribution that ships is assembled a layer up, in
//! `petri`, which is the crate that names them all.
