//! `attractor/fork`, `attractor/branch` and `attractor/fan_in`: a parallel
//! node, its branches as child invocations, and the barrier that collects their
//! envelopes.
//!
//! The fork step is the parallel node itself. It runs once per visit, before
//! any branch, and takes the fork snapshot: the parent's `kv` and, for agent
//! or prompt targets, the parent's stage records. Every branch child is
//! declared from that snapshot, its request and its three coordinator
//! records carry it, and every clone of a `for_each` template receives it as
//! its input token, so the fork offloads what would otherwise be copied per
//! child: the `for_each` source list at any size, and every other value
//! above [`blobs::FAN_OUT_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD`]. The snapshot then holds
//! `blob://sha256/<hex>` references in their place, one blob per value for
//! the whole fork, and the bytes per child do not grow with the item count.
//! The step's output is `{ snapshot, nodes, occurrence }`, where
//! `occurrence` is `{ fork, firing }`: this visit of the parallel node, which
//! every branch's call slot and every `fabro.parallel.*` event of the visit
//! names. The parent's own `kv` is not changed.
//!
//! The branch step is the parent-side half of one branch. It takes the fork
//! snapshot from its input, starts the branch's child graph as an internal
//! invocation that inherits the parent's sandbox and workspace, waits for
//! it, and returns the branch envelope Fabro's parallel handler builds:
//! `{ id, index, item_label?, status, context_updates }`. The updates are
//! built as Fabro's `branch_context_updates` builds them: the target's own
//! outcome updates first (an unchanged write-back included), then the public
//! diff of the child's context against the fork snapshot, the diff winning a
//! duplicate key. The envelope is the step's output and nothing else: a
//! branch's context changes never reach the parent's `kv`. The child bounds
//! its attempts through the coordinator's attempt admission under the fork's
//! gate, so `max_parallel` counts running attempts and a backoff holds no
//! slot.
//!
//! The fan-in step is the barrier. Its inputs carry every envelope in branch
//! order; it publishes `parallel.results` and `parallel.branch_count`, takes
//! Fabro's aggregate status, and fails with `No parallel results to join`
//! when what reached it are not branch envelopes. A result list above the
//! fan-out threshold is published as a reference, so a later fork does not
//! copy it into its children; logical readers (`stdin_source`, a prompted
//! fan-in, an agent's preamble) read the list back through the store.
